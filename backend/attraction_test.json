            "The food is good, you can bargain for the seafood set even if they already stated the price.\nThey would also let you choose what kind of sauce that you want.\nIt is near My Khe beach so very convenient if you stay around that area.\n\nThe downside is that there are very little stalls there. Very few people walked pass but maybe more people will come late at nightRead more",
            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",
            "This place was not even open, although the description on TripAdvisor says it‚Äôs open every night. Although looking in from the gate, this place is tiny so even when it‚Äôs open,  you won‚Äôt see a lot. Don‚Äôt waste time visiting this night market, go to the Son Tra market near the dragon bridge.Read more",
            "Not very impressed with this market and wouldn't have bothered if I'd known what tat it was they were selling. Cheap Chinese goods occupied most stalls.Had a very substandard foot massage which was frankly a waste of money.Can't comment on the food as I didn't eat there Read more",
            "I LOVED this.  So many things to try, but still a fairly gently experience if you arent used to markets like this. Delicious and affordable food everywhere. Each vendor will ask you ‚Äúhello! Would you like some [their food stall goodies]?‚Äù With menus and pictures. I suggest diving in and trying everything, however, if you would like to pass and keep walking, i found a ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù with a smile was easy and effective. Def bring cash and try everything! There are some repeat items, so its also a good idea to take a lap and plan your snacking. Its also awesome to watch them cook the items you choose.Read more",
            "Went for a stroll around the market. Got something small and sweet to eat. Typical market. Good vibes tho: Can recommend it for an after-dinner walk.Read more",
            "Not open and very small. Not worth the effort.Located in the Tourist streets of Da Nang close to the Beach. The main local markets are located near the Dragon bridge ( The head of the Dragon).Read more",
            "Well not sure about the other reviews, maybe they paid to go on an overpriced tour. We went by ‚Äògrab‚Äô taxi. The food was brilliant I tasted my first oyster the rice I had with my gambas  was really tasty with a hint of garlic. We went at the weekend and members of our party said the food was cheaper than during the week.  The market stalls were a bit overpriced but aren‚Äôt they all now, all over the world I don‚Äôt mind a bit of bartering so it‚Äôs never a problem if I particularly want something. I bought a new fancy selfie stick for around a fiver which I‚Äôm very pleased with.Read more",
            "This is a nice place in a local style. Danang night markets offer visitors dining and shopping paradises with a wide variety of dishes and items. Traveling to Danang, you definitely should come to these markets to immerse yourself in the bustling atmosphere here.Read more",
            "Food was overly priced. Not really worth the hype. It didn‚Äôt have a lot of variety, every stall was selling the same thing. It dies down after 9pm. We got the beef and octopus skewers and there was no taste to it. It just tasted like charcoal. They bombard you to order drinks when you order food.Read more",
            "Good massage. From the moment I came in the receptionist was very warm and gave us refreshments. Massage was superb and tailored towards my own wants. Would definitely come againRead more",
            "This is the worst night market I've visited in Vietnam. Very little variance of what's on offer, just a bunch of the same stalls selling the same stuff. Food is overpriced and not good at all. 30K for a bland pork skewer that took 15 minutes to receive. There is so much incredible food in Da Nang so this was a real let-down.Read more",
            "Open everyday??Read more",
            "So this seems like a fake night market. Why anyone would want to travel to Da Nang and eat pizza and tacos is beyond me. \nCan anyone tell me where a real night market is in Da Nang? With real local street food served by locals. Thanks.Read more",

Operating every night, Danang Night Market is rich with culture and food offerings from an assortment of culinary skilled vendors. From Philly cheesesteaks to Sake bar, local craft beer (and everything in between) it is the go-to for food lovers alike.Read more",

            "The food is good, you can bargain for the seafood set even if they already stated the price.\nThey would also let you choose what kind of sauce that you want.\nIt is near My Khe beach so very convenient if you stay around that area.\n\nThe downside is that there are very little stalls there. Very few people walked pass but maybe more people will come late at nightRead more",
            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",
            "This night market is ok. Check it out once but it‚Äôs not overly huge. Got a Banh Mi from a stall and it was not so good but it was only 20000 VND, just over $1 AUD so not a huge loss. It‚Äôs right next to the dragon bridge so go there on the weekend just before 9pm and see the fire display.Read more",
            "do not buy big lobsters-the people who sold them did not cook them properly-they were raw inside and the sellers were very dishonest and rudeRead more",
            "Place is invested with rats, litter lying around all over the place. Stay away there are many other bars and restaurants that sell good food and drinks with more affordable prices in the areaRead more",
            "Danang city is a clean city and i am not afraid to try its night market's food. Surprisingly it is far more cheaper and delicious too. We went there almost every night to enjoy variety of local foods.Read more",
            "Very fresh and a good variety. Deep dish pizza at Al‚Äôs, Thai, Vegetarian, Burgers, Pizza and more. Good prices, all made to order. I liked this because it wasn‚Äôt hectic and big. We loved it and chatting with the vendors. Read more",
            "This is not a Night Market. It is basically a small food court selling mostly western style food. When I went is was empty bar two or three people. Better of going to the real Night Market by Dragon Bridge.Read more",
            "This is a very small indoor food court, maybe ten stalls or so. One should not confuse this place with \"Son Tran Night Market\" which is located near the dragon bridge and is a big outdoor night market. Many of the photos you see in this TA page belongs to the Son Tra Night Market, not this place. THERE IS NO SEAFOOD HERE, if you are looking for the great seafood of Da Nang, you should go to Son Tra Night Market where you will find amazing seafood at very reasonable price. Anyway, we had delicious Banh Mis and deserts in this place.Read more",
            "This listing is for the small indoor night market made up of mostly expats offering international food. It‚Äôs nice. The food is great and the vendors friendly. It is not the big outdoor night market near Dragon Bridge. That one is much bigger and is mostly Vietnamese vendors. Many of the reviews here confuse the two. Read more",
            "Dinner at this place is a fun and cosy place, that can offer something for everyone. A lot of different Kitchens from all over the world who offer u a meal for a decent price.Read more",
            "Danang night market is across the Love Bridge near the dragon head end of the Dragon Bridge. You can visit all three attractions at the same vicinity - night market, Love Bridge and Dragon Bridge.We went last Sunday night by Grab car.  It is a huge night market with a number of impressive BBQ seafood stalls, and other non-food stalls. It was crowded and noisy, a vibrant place worth going to browse around even if you are not eating there or buying anything.Read more"

            "The food is good, you can bargain for the seafood set even if they already stated the price.\nThey would also let you choose what kind of sauce that you want.\nIt is near My Khe beach so very convenient if you stay around that area.\n\nThe downside is that there are very little stalls there. Very few people walked pass but maybe more people will come late at nightRead more",
            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",

            "just a small food market. about 8 stalls with limited seats - not very impressive. Not worth the travel, but no harm checking it out if you are nearby. Read more",
            "Everything looked interesting and we were happy that they opened this market near Dragon Bridge. Seafood looked fresh and inviting but the vendors did theiir best to make the dinner a  nightmare. First, they asked huge prices for the food and drinks, bigger than a cosy restaurant. Secondly, after accepting  a negotiation, the quantity of food was half than what we paid for.Disgusting mode of cheating...Some of them will never learn, they will always be a \" black ball\" for this beautiful country with welcoming people. Fortunately, my 4 years in Vietnam helped us to get out from this bad experience. Advise:if you are not together with a local person, better don't try the food there. Read more",

            "The night market is great to shop and eat, it's very festive. My daughter and I went to Da Nang and we felt totally safe to be out and about at night. Just use your common sense and be careful to watch the meter in the taxis, some will try to rip you off.Read more",

I also ordered edamame beans from a different counter as I could resist. The vibe here is good. We sat in the small courtyard to the side and really enjoyed ourselves. Would definitely recommend as there‚Äôs plenty of food options! Read more",
            "Ok...I may be writing this in the wrong place.  We found the \"real\" Da Nang Night Market here.  We Googled Da Nang Night Market and I am writing this review for the market named Ch·ª£ ƒê√™m ƒê√† N·∫µng -Danang Night Market.  This market is located near the eastern foot of the Dragon Bridge.  This is NOT the An Thuong Night Market.  Unfortunately the English TripAdvisor site does not have a separate page for this night market (there does appear to be a Vietnamese language page).  This is the night market not to miss!  This Night Market was fantastic!  Not touristy at all and full of locals! (I was one of two Caucasian faces that I saw).  And the seafood that we ate at in the family run food stalls was one of the food highlights of our trip to Vietnam!  Sure, there are a lot of vendors selling junk.  There are also a number of vendors selling various  food products that seem to be for locals to take home.  But the food stalls were fantastic.  The focus was mostly on live fresh seafood seasoned and grilled to order.  While many stalls had similar offerings...the preparations seemed to vary from stall to stall.  This was a real night market!  Highly Highly recommended!Read more",

            "The food is good, you can bargain for the seafood set even if they already stated the price.\nThey would also let you choose what kind of sauce that you want.\nIt is near My Khe beach so very convenient if you stay around that area.\n\nThe downside is that there are very little stalls there. Very few people walked pass but maybe more people will come late at nightRead more",
            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",

            "A great experience for our first night.  Tons of neat items to bargain for and buy.  It‚Äôs amazing to see how life in this city has changed since my time here in 1971.  This place gives you a good feel for the new Da Nang.Read more",
            "Had Gyoza, margaritas, Al's Chicago Deep Dish. Honestly this place is a really  nice escape from the same food for breakfast and lunch. Happy about the prices, everything is reasonable and the Chicago Deep Dish at Al's is a very good value for money. Check it out and support the local growing economy rather than one of the big resort places.Read more",
            "It was not crowded in the restaurant. Thus, I liked it and the food also clean and tasty. However, if you think like a real market, you can definitely disappointed with the size of the market. It is just a small food court where you stay at. I recommend you to visit this place for a bottle of beer and snacks after having dinner. I and my husband had bottles of beers and Japanese grilled chicken, dumping and Thai food. It was yummy but I was regret not having many kinds of Vietnamese food here.It was close to MiKe beach. The location was good to enough! Read more",
            "Waited over an hour for a single beef burrito. Seated myself directly in front of the stall, and had the joy of watching people arrive, order and receive their food while being told \"10min\" each time I went up to ask where my food was. I'd understand if it was a busy night, or they could not find me, but sitting there, watching, it definitely was not. Avoid if you want to eat in any reasonable timeframe.Read more",
            "No night market but just some tourist trap restaurants. The name is deceptive, only trying to bringt tourists here.Read more",
            "We visited this market by the dragon bridge with no great expectations...Firstly, the night views of the bridges are fantastic! Ever changing light show!The souvenir stalls are ok...but the food section was great, and very cheap.First we had a a Delat style pizza/pancake. This description isn't accurate, it's thin and crispy, with a delicious topping, cooked on charcoal then folded. Delicious, 80p each (UK)Next discovery was a seafood stall, just left of the arched lit up entry to the market. Tall skinny guy doing the cooking. Quite the best oysters and scallops we have EVER tasted! Mr Michelin should visit!! We had a plate of 6 mixed scallops and oysters cooked on a BBQ with a delicious dressing for ¬£2! They were SO delicious we went straight back for another plate! If you can find this stall you will not be disappointed!Read more",
            "What a great little find this food market is. The food here is excellent, best pizza I have tasted in weeks.The price is very cheap.Everything is cooker fresh in front of you.There is every cuisine here so don‚Äôt be put off by other ridiculous reviews. Read more"

            "The food is good, you can bargain for the seafood set even if they already stated the price.\nThey would also let you choose what kind of sauce that you want.\nIt is near My Khe beach so very convenient if you stay around that area.\n\nThe downside is that there are very little stalls there. Very few people walked pass but maybe more people will come late at nightRead more",
            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",

            "\"Night Market\" is a stretch!  After reading some of the previous reviews we were greatly disappointed when we finally found it.   It should have told us something when we stopped to ask some locals about the \"night market\" and they didn't know about it.   There were only about 5 stalls open.  Don't waste your time.   There are other streets in Da Nang that offer more.Read more",

I‚Äôve been back and because I‚Äôve made some really great friends while eating there.  Also, a local friend invited me to meet him there and we had a blast.  We sat at the same stall at the back of the market and made all sorts of friends.  Sorry, I never made it past the tacos as they are so yummy!  I just go straight there but am sure other foods are good as well.Read more",
            "When I heard about this night market I expected hundreds of food stalls, gift shops, etc.  What I found was maybe 15ish stalls.  It was very small and not what I expected.  Too bad really as I expected more.  Maybe it was my fault for setting my expectations of a \"night market\" too high.I will admit though, the food I did get (crepe and bun mi) was tasty.Read more",

            "The food is good, you can bargain for the seafood set even if they already stated the price.\nThey would also let you choose what kind of sauce that you want.\nIt is near My Khe beach so very convenient if you stay around that area.\n\nThe downside is that there are very little stalls there. Very few people walked pass but maybe more people will come late at nightRead more",
            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",
            "It's just a bunch of mini-restaurant stalls shoved into a house.  A bunch of them aren't even open.  It seems to do OK with the locals which is how I ended up here but if you are just visiting don't waste your time.  I had few enough nights, shouldn't have spent time here.Read more",
            "Had a great feed here two nights in a row because food was so good the first night. Similar to a food-truck style food outlets for drinks and desserts. Night food market with live dj and plenty of options for dinner and open late.Plenty of varied options, fish, thai, Vietnamese, ca phe, beer, sake, burgers etc etc.  Give it a go!Read more",
            "Though it's small... Some nice places to eat. But guess we went there too early... As there were hardly people, guess it's made for tourists and nice if u pass by if u r around my khe beach.Read more",
            "Too small to be called night market, but passed by after got dining at other resto, still had to buy some here, cause they were good. Not many stands, but all are trying their best. So 5 star for their trying.Read more",
            "Small but enough. First time try frog skin deep fried. It was so good. And the shocked price: 1 usd for a big dish. UnforgettableRead more",
            "Decided to make a trip there tonight after reading some of the reviews here. Was totally disappointed when i got there. Only a handful of stores and nothing to shout about. Within 5mins I had completed the tour of the market and decided to adjourn another place for dinner. There are only a handful of stores and the night market name is quite misleading. Seriously i think it's total waste of my time there tonight. Read more",

            "I was walking around and stumbled upon this cute little market. I bought some french pastries @ LeBordeaux : the macarons and canel√©s were wonderful, as good as those I had in Paris ! I did not buy anything else, but the other booths seemed to make very nice dishes ! I recommend to stop by, settle down with some friends for an hour and enjoy the   atmosphere there. Read more",
            "I ended up in this night market following some friends, great place if you don't know what to eat at night. Plenty of choices from tacos and cajun shrimps to Belgian waffles. After eating, we stopped by the small bar with the 10 shots challenge, great place to have fun with a group of friends. Overall, I loved the atmosphere of the night market, the only downside is that it could be a little bit bigger.Read more",

            "The food is good, you can bargain for the seafood set even if they already stated the price.\nThey would also let you choose what kind of sauce that you want.\nIt is near My Khe beach so very convenient if you stay around that area.\n\nThe downside is that there are very little stalls there. Very few people walked pass but maybe more people will come late at nightRead more",
            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",
            "I came here once and I think it's good night market. Great food and drink around there. Cool thing abt this place is the Japanese liquor shop. I pretty like that Ume drink it's sweet and absolutely good to me. And if you ever come there don't for her to try Tacos in there. It's amazingly stunning. They only have flour Tacos but however the meet and the sauce are seriously delightful and freshly.I definitely will come back if I have a chance.Read more",
            "The night market is just what the An Thuong area needs. Great food and vibe!  Lots of interesting local and international foods to try. Good options for drinking too; 7 Bridges has a booth and check out the best bartender in town at the saki bar in the back!  Definitely a must stop while in Danang!Read more",
            "This night market in the heart of Da Nang's tourist district has awesome foods that are prepared with high quality ingredients. I think it may be because most stalls are run by expats that have brought their own culinary ways and tastes. The market is upkept and clean with a very quaint atmosphere. My family spent a week in Da Nang and we came here every night haha so much delicious foods to chose from! Our kids especially loved the lovely Banh Xeo stall! I didn't chose the banh xeo life, the banh xeo life chose me!Read more",

            "The big spiny lobster was very delicious.I went there two days.On the first day, I ordered by pointing at a restaurant with a normal menu with prices. I was surprised at the amount of food, which was like a yellow egg roll with shrimp. It came with rice paper and leafy vegetables to eat with it.The person next to me was eating it with gusto, so I decided to try shrimp tomorrow.On the second day, the lady at the middle store gave me a set of two spiny lobsters, regular shrimp, and shellfish for 450KD, so I ordered that. I ordered the regular shrimp with garlic margarine and the spiny lobster with mayonnaise. It came with shellfish and octopus. The spiny lobster is a bargain compared to Japan. The meat was packed even down to the legs, so it was satisfying to eat. It was bland, so they would give you soy sauce, fish sauce, etc. if you ask. I ordered it well done. Drinks were 25KD beer and 35KD strawberry shake. After that, I was full after eating grilled yakitori and corn for 20KD, two bottles of beer, and sugar cane juice for 20KD. They served me fried water spinach for free. It was delicious with garlic and chili pepper seasoning.Read more",

            "What an exciting night at the Night Market ! From our hotel,  we took a ride to the night market. There were ready made dresses, souvenirs, other items and ready to eat food including fresh seafoods. We selected some fresh seafoods and had it cook based on its displayed menu. After partaking their delicious food we headed to other sections and saw assorted items for display. What fun night!\nMake sure you are ready to be gastronomically adventurous as there are so much food to choose from. Just choose what you can consume üòäRead more",
            "Fun experience if you want to just take a stroll around a night market. Advice for tourists, beware of the seafood sets at the vendors. Even if you bargained with them, you will not get the same set. Those sets are just for displays. Cheaper to just go to local seafood restaurants. Also, don‚Äôt set for the prices for clothes, toys, accessories etc. you can bargain way lower than what they marked.Read more",
            "The Da Nang Street Market is really underwhelming. There isn't much variety of food vendors, the prices for everything are really high, everyone is hassling you to buy from their stall, the quality of the food is not good, and it's very crowded with tourists. Maybe stop by if you need to kill time before seeing the dragon bridge show, but it's really not worth your time or money to go this night market.Read more",

            "Went to the night market after the Dragon bridge show. Didn't even stay as it was super touristy, pretty expensive for a night market and you were hassled everywhere you walked. Didn't get a single thing to eat. Super dissapointedRead more",

            "We spent two nights here total. The first night was on a weeknight, it was less crowded. The market has many vendors which included food, goods from China, massage vendors. The first night we tried a few items that were decent. There was a lady who gave me some juice that was supposed to be cane but it was not. Didn‚Äôt want to make a big fuss about it so we left. It tasted decent, but I knew it was not cane juice. We got two b√°nh m√¨ sandwiches that were good. We got squid on a skewer which was decent as well. We saw lobster and seafood vendor and the Lady was really nice. She had very good sauce so we wanted to come back because at that point we were already full. Two nights later, we went to the same vendor and she sold us a tray that costed 800,000 dong. However, she told us to sit somewhere further out, and she did not bring us all that we ordered. She did not give us the same sauce, and her attitude was very different after we were sold. Many of the vendors Are not honest and want to raise their prices and not give you what you ask for. This has been a common theme throughout our trip unfortunately. The raise of the price for foreigners.Read more",
            "We spent few hours in an evening, had BBQ seafood and bought some clothing. There are many BBQ seafood stall to pick from, for about S$28 we get a plater or two medium size lobster, some squids, prawns and clams BBQ and served on those low tables and chairs on the sides, good for an experience eating this manner, but how food were prepared, and cook may make some wondered if they will be fine :)Other items on sale are the same of most places, but it seems this place has low tolerance for bargaining.The place is comparatively more spacious and cleaner than those one may find in such places as Taiwan and Malaysia.Read more",
